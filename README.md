# Understanding @Lob and JSON Storage in Spring Boot: PostgreSQL vs MySQL Pitfalls

In this article, I share my experience working with Spring Boot, JPA, and two major relational databases—PostgreSQL and MySQL—while trying to store JSON data using `@Lob`.

---

## 💡 Problem Overview

When working with JPA and Spring Boot, it's common to store large data like JSON strings in the database using the `@Lob` annotation.

### Sample Entity
This works flawlessly in MySQL, but causes unexpected issues in PostgreSQL.

```java
@Lob
@Column(name = "request_payload", columnDefinition = "TEXT")
private String requestPayload;
```
🧨 The PostgreSQL Issue
```java
Could not extract column [8] from JDBC ResultSet [Bad value for type long: {"key": "value"}]
```
This is telling you: Hibernate is expecting a Long value from column #8, but got the JSON Value clearly shows Hibernate is misinterpreting the column type.
because your data type is string and hibernate expected the long data type of columns.

### So what’s wrong?
Hibernate doesn’t know how to handle jsonb in PostgreSQL by default — it just sees an object, tries to convert it to a Long, and fails.

```java
@Lob
@Column(name = "request_payload")
private String requestPayload;
```
Hibernate doesn't map jsonb to String automatically — it still gets confused unless explicitly told to treat it as text.

------------This issue refelct only when use the postgresql why ??-------------------------

# In PostgreSQL :- 
@Lob annotations are generally treated as large binary objects or large text (bytea or text types in PostgreSQL). When you're working with large objects (like JSON, strings, or binary data), Hibernate often defaults to using OID or bytea, which leads to the problem you're experiencing.

# In MySQL :- 
the handling of @Lob can be different. MySQL uses types like TEXT or BLOB for large objects, and Hibernate may not default to OID for @Lob fields as it does with PostgreSQL. In MySQL, Hibernate will typically map a @Lob field to a TEXT or BLOB, and this behavior is less prone to causing issues because MySQL's TEXT type is more directly mapped to a Java String.

Solution Which i tried work seamlessely for stored the json:- 
``` java
@Column(name = "response_payload", columnDefinition = "jsonb")
    private String responsePayload; // JSON stored as string
```

🛠️ Recommendation
-> For PostgreSQL, avoid @Lob with JSON unless you explicitly use TEXT.

-> For MySQL, @Lob works fine.

-> Prefer jsonb if you want indexing and query support in PostgreSQL.

### Summary 
When working with JSON in Spring Boot, it's crucial to understand how different databases handle @Lob. MySQL handles it smoothly as LONGTEXT, while PostgreSQL may default to OID, causing errors. To avoid issues, use TEXT or jsonb with proper annotations and dependencies. Choosing the right approach ensures compatibility and performance across databases.
